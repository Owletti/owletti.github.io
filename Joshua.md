## Function
- Detect weapons on students accurately
- Ignore personal items (pens, watches, artifical joints)
- When an alarm is raised, deal with the situation quickly


## Purpose:
- Students feel safer in schools
    - Very accurate, and non invasive. The Evolv Express can process 10x the amount of people that a standard metal detector can (at about 60ppl/min), leading to a nearly seamless detection system.
- Greatly reduce the risk of a weapon being brought into the school, by detecting them and acting as a deterrent to bringing one in the first place
    - In the event that a weapon is detected, the Evolv Express uses AI-enabled cameras to direct the security team directly to the student that set off the alarm, as opposed to searching everybody in the vicinity. 
- Be affordable, and therefore equitable, to schools
    - Costs around $70,000/yr, which is a lot, but still $30,000 less than what we give our football team. 


## Concerns
- While unlikely, false alarms can still happen
    - Even in the event that they do, all it would take is a secondary check to send the student on their way.
- 70k/yr operating price could cause budgeting issues, leading to cutting educational programs
- Could cause anxiety for some students
