## Biology Animated Studios / Simulator by M.I.T.
Purpose:

The specific groups in the school community I believe would benefit from this innovation are high school students or middle school students who are involved in interest-biology clubs, common core or advanced placement biology students, or students studying or applying biology for academic competitions or research events during their high school career.

## Benefits:
- Vast Amount of Content: Biology covers a wide range of topics, from molecular biology to ecology, and students often struggle with the sheer amount of information they need to learn and understand.
- Complex Terminology
- Conceptual Understanding
- Visualizing Abstract Concepts
    - The high amount of complex terminology and conceptual understanding will be easier for biology students to absorb due to the practice of putting what they know into application through visual learning environments, such as 3d simulations and laboratory scenarios or challenges.
    - The ability to design one’s visual understanding of biological concepts increases one’s ability to apply what they hear in class from the teacher.
    - Through the practice of compiling their knowledge onto this platform, reviewing simulated biological concepts and processes, makes it much easier and faster to grasp complex interactions between biological concepts.

## Function 
- MIT’s biology animation studios refers to the recreation of learning biology depicted on a computer screen that is interactive and immersive for students to learn faster through the application of academic material into real-life scenarios.
- When taking part in this simulation, learners experience simulated lab events and constructed biological elements from a computer screen, frequently interacting with the environment and controlling their avatars with a mouse or keyboard.
- Collected data includes editing preferences for their digital design of the biological structure, and responses to the real-world scenarios.
- Based on the data of answers, editing preferences for their digital design of the biological structure and responses, an automatic report that is generated once the simulation is finished gives standardized feedback on whether the student completed the scenario learning objectives.

## Concerns
- The immersion, authenticity, and realism of the simulation experience can be diminished by using menu-based activities and conversations when interacting from a computer screen. A menu-based system may urge the learner to execute an activity or communication they may not have otherwise considered, even though effective cueing is a vital facilitation method.
- The assessment of some psychomotor skills that demand precise, fine motor movements may be constrained because students frequently interact with the environment using a mouse or keyboard.
- One cybersecurity technique that could be used to make the innovation more secure would be a security measure of accessing the control of which data and systems are shared with 3rd parties or publicized. This way, the student’s progress of his/her learning via this simulation can be kept private if chosen, unless mandatory by the teacher to secure a student’s possible insecurities.
