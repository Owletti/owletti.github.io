## Innovation 1: Augmented Reality
Augmented reality allows people to apply their learning from school into real life situations, by allowing them to envision their learning in real life.

## Innovation 2: E.D.I.S
Using AI to find education gaps, and to find learning styles for each student. Then with this information, a curriculum can be made either for individual students or for the entire class that uses how the students learn the best to create engaging learning to eliminate gaps in understanding.


## Innovation 3: WOIS Career Information System
Career Guidance allows students to get a boost in learning by finding their interests and careers faster, increasing study time by removing the time to search for possible careers. This connects to the theme by helping students learn about their jobs and practice through outside learning.
