## Purpose and Benefits:
**Purpose**:
- The program focuses on the students' advancement in learning through speeding up the picking process for careers.
- It collects information about the student’s interests to find and help the student gain knowledge about that career and how to follow it.

**Benefits**:
- Newly initiated students can use this program to more quickly find a focus in studies. The student can spend less time doing all sorts of classes and spend a little time looking for the best one for themselves.
- They can spend more resources on one subject because they know its what they want to learn about and possibly major in after graduation. 
- Students could spend more time getting ready for other important knowledge such as working at a job or being an intern.

**Function**:
- There are multiple surveys that together have enough information to find similar careers that match the interests or skills of the student using the program.
- Collects Student’s:
    - Interests
    - Work Ethic
    - Skills
- The student interacts with the program by filling out surveys that narrow down the career options the student might be interested or skilled in. 

There is a tab with a list of surveys that collect information to narrow down the ideal careers the user would like. It would collect interests, work ethic, skills, to find careers for the user. The user creates an account with their personal information that saves their survey details to their account. The information would be stored in the surveys where you can clear the information and redo the survey or export it. Results of the survey would be sent to the users email which is stored when creating the account. The user does not sign in with any personal information, meaning the log in information would not connect to any safe information deposits.

**Concerns**:
A huge concern with the innovation is bias. The program might favor some students over others based on their interests, such as having less career choices for one category, or available study materials for education. The students could be held back from their full potential because they don’t have all the resources available to them. Because of bias the student might graduate without full knowledge to chase their career. The information gathered can easily be used to gain information that is harmful to the user, such as name, career survey results, and email. Using all of this information they could phish you and get you to fill in information on a fraud website using the survey results as a bait for the trap.
