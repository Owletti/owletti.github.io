Augmented reality allows people to apply their learning from school into real life situations, by allowing them to envision their learning in real life.

**Purpose and Benefits**: 
- People who struggle to apply their learning in real life would benefit from this
    - Envision their learning by overlaying things they learned in school onto their outside world
- This innovation allows them to take their learning from one context and apply it to another

**Function**:
- The innovation takes data from the user's outside environment and processes the objects around, and uses data from its database to overlay images onto what it sees

**Concerns**:
- One group that could potentially be harmed is the people who are not as good with   technology or don’t have access to this technology
    - Either them or their school can’t afford it. Since they can’t use it, others are more likely to get an unfair advantage ahead of them
- One way to lessen the digital divide with AR is offering use of AR in libraries, kind of like how people can use computers and printers in libraries. That way everyone has access to AR.
